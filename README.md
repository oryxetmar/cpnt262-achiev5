Not going to lie, this is clearly not a strong point for me. However, after a weekend of youtube videos: I seem to be understanding slightly more than I have so far. 

1.) I struggled understanding the actual loop idea. And obviosuly am still confused but needed to jsut submit this because ive been sittig on it for two days hoping I can suddenyl understand it all. nope. 

2.) Videos used:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2tJ3nzXh8I
- different ways of outputting variables:
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb33AmWDmrg
- object keys, values and entry methods
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmicKaGcs5g

3.) I am hoping to at least pass this assignment as I THINK I have:
- declared an empty output variable
- made an array list of items
- assigned
